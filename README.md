Inspired by the "PKU Folk Lesson Information Collection", I started this project.

It is said that the characteristics of our institute or our school are that there is no calendar year question: whether it is looking in the group or asking the senior student, it is often difficult to get the calendar year question.

This inevitably casts a shadow on my students and other students' preparation for the exam.

According to the book Cognitive Nature, people not only need to actively recall, but also need quizes to test learning outcomes.

Even if you work hard to prepare, have not seen the calendar year questions in person, and have not done it, it is still easy to lack confidence.

The teacher's reluctance to provide past questions may be a reflection of the teacher's "laziness" or insufficient incentive to come up with new questions on the final exam.

But the environment has come to this point, I can only make some modest efforts, hoping to help the future students and students, but also to pay tribute to the senior students who have helped me.

As the conclusion of the preface to the Pku project says:

I hope that as long as it is the detour taken by the predecessors, the future generations will not have to go again.
